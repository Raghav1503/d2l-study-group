This project is adapted from the original [Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai) book by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, Alex J. Smola and all the community contributors. GitHub of the original book: [https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en). We have made an effort to modify the book and convert the MXnet code snippets into PyTorch and Tensorflow.

Note: Some ipynb notebooks may not be rendered perfectly in Github. We suggest `cloning` the repo or using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to view the notebooks.

# Installation
:label:`chap_installation`

Please follow the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to acquire all the tools and the code of the book which is necessary to begin our course.

## Contributing

  * Please feel free to open a Pull Request to contribute a notebook in PyTorch or tensorflow for the rest of the chapters. Before starting     out with the notebook, open an issue with the name of the notebook in order to contribute for the same. We will assign         that issue to you (if no one has been assigned earlier).

  * Strictly follow the naming conventions for the IPython Notebooks and the subsections.

  * Also, if you think there's any section that requires more/better explanation, please use the issue tracker to 
    open an issue and let us know about the same. We'll get back as soon as possible.

  * Find some code that needs improvement and submit a pull request.

  * Find a reference that we missed and submit a pull request.

  * Try not to submit huge pull requests since this makes them hard to understand and incorporate. 
    Better send several smaller ones.
